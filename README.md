# Business Problem
Bombabomba.com has tested Facebook's new bidding type called 'average bidding' as an alternative to 'maximum bidding'. They want to know if average bidding is more effective in terms of converting potential customers into actual buyers. To test this, they have been running an A/B test for a month, and now they need you to analyze the results. The success of this test will be measured based on the number of purchases made by customers. Therefore, the statistical analysis should focus on the Purchase metric.

# Story of the Dataset
In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are in separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and AverageBidding was applied to the test group.
